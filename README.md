# GeoQuiz
This is a very basic android application which I developed while I was learning Android Development. <br/>
It is a Quiz App which consists of five questions from Geography and also gives the user an option to cheat. But if the user cheats, he/she is penalized accordingly. On completing all five questions, a popup showing the percentage scored by the user is displayed.
## Screenshots
This app consists of two activities. The first one is the Main Activity, i.e the activity which opens on starting the app-
